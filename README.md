# Knowing where to tap: the magical art of problem solving

To some solving technical problems seems like a dark art. Whereby some people
posses a certain sixth sense for finding out how or where things go wrong.
Everyone has encountered such "magical" events to the extent that the bill
that often follows when asking people for such services has been at the origin
of myth.

> A town’s electricity generator failed and various engineers were unable to fix
it, so an elderly professor was summoned. He examined the generator carefully, 
then tapped it lightly once with a hammer, and power was instantly restored. 
He submitted his bill for $1,000.02 and itemized it:
“Tapping — $.02. Knowing where to tap — $l,000.”

This impression that part of it is somewhat magical or at least rooted in an
extensive body of knowledge can be very daunting to students. Although it is
true that lived experiences can't be easily substituted, and for sure this helps
in quickly solving problems by recognizing certain patterns, it is not the only
way to acquire elderly professor skills.

This set of chapters / lectures tries to put a finger on how to best solve
technical problems using various systems. It explores how to approach technical
problems, in both software and hardware, which will allow you to speed up your work
whenever you are stuck or things break on you. Due to the nature of my experience
and the questions by students I will first and foremost focus on software 
rather than hardware (although some comments will be made where I see fit).

It is important to note that what is described in these chapters are approaches
that are valid within the technical business sphere only. Problem solving is
highly context specific. Approach social and political problems using these 
techniques will invariably result in failure a slap in the face, or a lost job.
People are not car engines, chunks of code or pieces of furniture to be 
rearranged at will. I will even go further to say that many of the world's 
problems originate in the application of an engineering problem solving mindset
to what is inherently a social and political problem.

Furthermore, the routines as described are meant for non life-threatening 
situations only. When dealing with extreme danger, e.g. accidents in a machine
shop and medical emergencies the routines described in this manual are generally
too slow. Emergency problem solving relies mostly on a vast body of readily 
available knowledge and only in part on iterative deduction. Although being
aware of some of these techniques might help you, seek a medical professional
before intervening yourself.

With these warnings in place, please enjoy learning some shortcuts to the magical
art of problem solving.
